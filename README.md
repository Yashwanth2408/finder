# Dynamic Route Optimization and Emission Reduction System

This project aims to build a Python-based application to optimize vehicle routes dynamically using real-time traffic, weather, and vehicle data. The system will also estimate and minimize emissions for sustainability.

## Features:
- Real-time traffic updates
- Weather impact on routes
- Vehicle-specific route optimization
- Emission estimation and reduction
